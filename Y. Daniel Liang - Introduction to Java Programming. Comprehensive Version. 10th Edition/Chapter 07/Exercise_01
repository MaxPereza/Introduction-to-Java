*/
Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score,
and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is Ú best - 10
Grade is B if score is Ú best - 20;
Grade is C if score is Ú best - 30;
Grade is D if score is Ú best - 40;
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.
