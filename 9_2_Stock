/*The Stock class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2,
design a class named Stock that contains:
■ A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
■ A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
■ A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock
price for the previous day.
■ A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the
current time.
■ A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
■ A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed
from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.
Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
program that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol ORCL, the name
Oracle Corporation, and the previous closing price of 34.5. Set a new current
price to 34.35 and display the price-change percentage.*/

        {
            hight = currentPrice;

        double percent = ((hight - low) / hight) * 100;
        return (int)(percent * 100)/100.0;
